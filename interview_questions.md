# Some interview questions you may be asked

- Your name
- if you're comfortable being quoted
- Where you were during WannaCry
- What your role was
- If you felt safe
- If you know of people harmed by WannaCry in hospitals or medical care

- If you were a member of NHS staff/IT expert

- - What happened?  How did WannaCry impact your work that day?  And going forward?
- - Have there been any changes to policies or workflows as a result of this?
- - Are there other changes that you think should happen (or any changes that you think were a mistake)?
- - Did you feel it was handled well at the time?
- - Looking back, could we have done things differently?
- - How much of this is related to your specific setup, vs. the local Trust, vs the NHS generally?
- - If you could pass on one piece of advice to someone in your position, what would it be?
- - Is there anyone else you would recommend that I talk to about this?
 
- If you were a patient/know a patient impacted by WannaCry

Please remember: anything you tell me will be held in strictest confidence, but you do not need to tell me about medical or personal details. You can keep the conversation very general.  If you feel upset, or would rather not talk about anything, we can skip questions or stop the interview.  If you would like to try again later that?s OK too.  I am interested in your story, and in what we can learn from this to improve the situation going forward.
